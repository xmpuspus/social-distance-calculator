### Deployment Through Web Application

I used the most recently released API of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) to deploy the ml model and locally serve the web app.

### Running the App

In order to run the app, you must install streamlit using:

```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install streamlit
```
Afterwards, run this on the terminal:

```console
foo@bar:~$ streamlit run app.py
```

### Display

The web app should look something like this:
